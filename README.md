# talk
**talk** is a simple anonymous chat application written in JavaScript. This is my first attempt at using NodeJS.

## Usage
Make sure you are in the project directory and run `node index.js` to start the server. After it has started
the server can be accessed at `localhost`. The web frontend uses port 80 (the HTTP default) and the websocket
powering the communication uses port 8080. Both of the ports have to be availible for the server to work.
