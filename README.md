# talk
**talk** is a simple anonymous chat application written in JavaScript. This is my first attempt at using NodeJS.

## Demo
A demo is deployed [here](https://fylipp-talk.herokuapp.com).

## Installation
Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Usage
Make sure you are in the project directory and run `npm start` to start the server. After it has started
the server can be accessed at `localhost`. The web frontend uses port 80 (or `process.env.PORT` if available). The websocket powering the communication is attached to the web server.
